.. The Pythonic Way web site master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to The Pythonic Way
===========================

| The aim of this site is to provide a cookbook (working examples) or courses on specific topics programming with the best programming language: Python ;-)
| If you want to improve the content of this website, fork me (https://github.com/freeh4cker/the_pythonic_way) and submit a pull request (see contributing).
| Before to dive into Python I can not prevent myself from remember these few guiding principles for Python's design.

      <h1>The Zen of Python.</h1>

      <ul>
         <li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
         <li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
         <li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
         <li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
         <li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
         <li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
         <li>Readability counts.</li>
         <li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
         <li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
         <li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
         <li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
         <li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
         <li>There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.</li>
         <li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
         <li>Now is better than never.</li>
         <li>Although never is often better than *right* now.</li>
         <li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
         <li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
         <li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
      </ul>
