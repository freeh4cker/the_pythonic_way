or courses on specific topics programming with the best programming language: Python ;-)

# Contributing, Bug Reports

If you are interested to contribute to this web site, fork this project and submit a pull request.

I use sphinx to generate html (in a directory named *docs*) and use github pages functionality
to publish the content of docs directory (in master branch) as web site (see
[project pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) ).

To contribute, fix bugs (typos, error),

 1. install sphinx
 2. fork the project
 3. create new page or fix a page
 4. check the result locally
 5. ask for a pull request on the source code, not on the generate html :-)
